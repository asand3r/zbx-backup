# v0.5

v0.5 has many improvements and got something about user-friendly interface.  
Now, you can use arguments in command-line, decide which program to use for backing up database and compress result files.  
Also I've added much more checks, error processing, so I hope it can helps to prevent some user's errors.  
Now we've got '-h|--help' argument, which show small help message and I think it's good. =)
